## Description
Display nearby planes in a user -defined radius around the userâ€™s IP location or a custom set location. Each plane in the vicinity of the user will be plotted on a graph that overlays a map. When a point is hovered, one can click on it to be redirected to another page that tells more information about that flight, such as flight time, plane model, altitude, and current latitude and longitude. Of course, none of this could be done with the amazing API's that we meshed together, as shown below.
