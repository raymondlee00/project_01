finalized the idea for the project; brainstormed for ideas; going with jesse's idea of using the opensky api to find nearby planes and using accuweather to dtermine the weather around where the plane is. we will also use the iplocation api to estimate planes around a certain radius

successfully connected to the OpenSky API and has made unsuccessful attempts to calculate the bounds of latitude/longitude from user-defined radius/circle

updated the design doc's list of components and mvp; brainstormed the bounds of latitude/longitude with jesse (formula is now maybe successful?)

set up several things and showed group members how to manually install packages

worked on the basic layout for authentication system for other group members to build off up, especially Jesse since he needs a way to tell uniqueness of users; created a separate branch called login to not interfere with Jesse's plane code
