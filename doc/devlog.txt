Created devlog and doc folder

rayL -- 2019-11-15 00:13
added updateLog.py; credit goes out to my man junhee lee

rayL -- 2019-11-15 00:16
added static/css folder and main.css file in static/css

rayL -- 2019-11-15 09:26
finalized the idea for the project; brainstormed for ideas; going with jesse's idea of using the opensky api to find nearby planes and using accuweather to dtermine the weather around where the plane is. we will also use the iplocation api to estimate planes around a certain radius

JesseH -- 2019-11-15 20:27
successfully connected to the OpenSky API and has made unsuccessful attempts to calculate the bounds of latitude/longitude from user-defined radius/circle

rayL -- 2019-11-15 20:28
updated the design doc's list of components and mvp; brainstormed the bounds of latitude/longitude with jesse (formula is now maybe successful?)

rayL -- 2019-11-15 22:10
updated the design doc on MVP

vishwaaS -- 2019-11-16 06:30
refined design doc and finished sitemap

rayL -- 2019-11-18 03:46
uploaded design doc

jesseH -- 2019-11-19 08:22
added/updated a bunch of python files for connecting to the opensky-api and displaying plot points on a graph

rayL -- 2019-11-19 09:23
updated .gitignore to ignore keys.txt
jesseH -- 2019-11-19 08:30
set up several things and showed group members how to manually install packages

rayL,vishwaaS -- 2019-11-19 20:25
worked on the basic layout for authentication system for other group members to build off up, especially Jesse since he needs a way to tell uniqueness of users; created a separate branch called login to not interfere with Jesse's plane code

made database with the necessary functions teammates asked fore, working on an update function and how to incorporate dict datatype there

This piece of text was really enlightening.
1. There is no I in team. Only the first person plural should be used, never first person singular
2. Programming is thought of to be a very solitary thing to do, yet it is unironically requires a lot more teamwork than expected for programmers to churn out something awe-inspiring

rayL --2019-11-22 04:12
updated the README.md with description and instructions to install

rayL --2019-11-22 04:18
updated the design doc with changes:
the user will now have to input the radius of querying for nearby planes, instead of the +/- variance of latitude and longitude that makes it easier for the API to process but more complex for the user. Overall improving UX
the user will now be able to interact with the map that is generated after they search for nearby planes. Plot points on the graph of the generated map will lead to a separate route that shows more information about that flight: current latitude and longitude, flight time, altitude, temperature in its vicinity, etc.

vishwaaS -2019-11-22 08:34
added navbar to the base.html

vishwaaS -2019-11-22 08:39
added navbar to all pages -- can't do other bootstrap since routes.py is broken

rayL --2019-11-22 11:31
added a navbar element, which an account dropdown with logout button

rayL -- 2019-11-22 13:18
updated the vsco-logo to be transparent

rayL -- 2019-11-24 19:31
added sliders to the radius form as a more fitting HTML element than in-line text boxes

rayL -- 2019-11-24 21:00
added plane favicon

vishwaaS -- 2019-11-25 08:32
updated radiusform.html to show user information that makes their experience better

rayL -- 2019-11-25 09:07
added flat earth using WebGL API with minimal JS

vishwaaS -- 2019-11-25 09:09
finished routing and designing picker.html to allow user to decide whether they want to use their current location or a random location

rayL, vishwaaS -- 2019-11-25 10:15
changed style to something more cool and funky
